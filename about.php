                        <p>Today India standup under the theme of digital India, skill India and make in India. It has many
                            advantages as the world’s fastest growing economy including the very large young population.</p>
                        <p>All across the globe there is interest in India as an coming global power. In these inspiring times, the biggest challenge is to prepare the youth who are educated and capable, with skills and the intellectual capacity to meet the various needs and requirement for developing the nation.
                            In present education system there is need to prepare the finest minds in the world. In this context the education system in Shree Ghanshyam Academy, Naranpar (CBSE School), looks at the holistic development of the youth of the country , I would like to emphasize on the three aspects which are of the almost focus in our school and which are very important for the overall development of children. One is Knowledge, second is values associated with knowledge and third is spirit to work together.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Education is about knowledge, knowledge without values is incomplete. It is a value system
                            that can prepare the younger generation to become responsible citizens who contribute to
                            the welfare of society and advancement of the human act. The person equipped with knowledge and values has important role to build a spirit of working together constructively.
                            I promise an adherence of the above, together we can and we will steer the change.</p>
